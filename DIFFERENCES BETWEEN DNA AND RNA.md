# DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DNA AND RNA
  
  
  | ASPECT | DNA | RNA |
| --- | --- | ---|
|  STRUCTURE | DOUBLE STRANDED | SINGLE STRANDED |
| LOCATION | NUCLEUS AND MITOCHONDRIA OF CELLS | NUCLEUS, CYTOPLASM , RIBOSOME |
| STABILITY | DNA IS A MORE  STABLE MOLECULE THAN RNA IT IS IN ALKALINE CONDITIONS | RNA IS MORE REACTIVE AND NOT STABLE IN ALKALINE CONDITIONS |
| NITROGENOUS BASES | ADENINE GUANINE CYTOSINE THYMINE | ADENINE GUANINE CYTOSINE URACIL |
|ULTRA- VIOLET SENSITIVITY | DNA IS VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE BY UV | RNA IS MORE RESISTANT TO DAMAGE BY UV THAN DNA |
| COMPOSITION | DEOXYRIBOSE SUGAR, PHOSPHATE GROUP, NITROGENOUS BASES | RIBOSE SUGAR, PHOSPHATE GROUP, NITROGENOUS BASES |
| FUNCTION | STORES GENETIC INFORMATION | TRANSMITS GENETIC CODE FROM NUCLEUS TO THE RIBOSOMES TO MAKE PROTEINS |
| PROPAGATION | DNA IS SELF REPLICATING | RNA IS SYNTHESIZED FROM DNA |
