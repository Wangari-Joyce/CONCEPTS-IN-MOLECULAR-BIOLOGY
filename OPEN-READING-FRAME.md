# CONCEPT OF THE OPEN READING FRAME

- The **OPEN READING FRAME**  is used determines which amino acids will be encoded by a gene.
- Only one reading frame is used in translating a gene (in eukaryotes), and this is often the longest open reading frame.
- The genetic codes reads DNA sequence in groups of three bases such that only 6 possible sequences can be obtained 3 in the forward and 3 in the reverse strand 
- Once the open reading frame is known the DNA sequence can be translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence. 
-  An open reading frame starts with an ATG (Met) in most species and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG or TGA). 
   
   
   
   EXAMPLE:
   In a sequence below the longest ORF is in the first read.
