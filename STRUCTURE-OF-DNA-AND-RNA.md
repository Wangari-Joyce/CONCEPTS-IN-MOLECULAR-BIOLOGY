# THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF DNA
**DNA** is molecule consisting of two polynucleotide chains that are wound around each other to form a double helix. The two polynucleotides are usually made up of simple monomeric units called nucleotides.
A Nucleotide is usually made up of one of the four nitrogenous bases; **ADENINE(A) CYTOSINE (C) GUANINE (G) AND THYMINE (T)**, A deoxyribose sugar ( a sugar derived from a ribose sugar by loss of an oxygen atom at the 2' end) and a phosphate group.
The nucleotides are joined to each other by covalent bonds known as a phosphodiester bond which a linkage between one of the nucleotide's sugar and a phosphate of the next nucleotide. this forms a  **sugar-phoshate backbone**
The bases of the double stranded DNA, are joined together with hydrogen bonds following the base pairing rule, where A pairs with T and G pairs with C

## PURINES AND PYRIMIDINES
The complementary bases are divided into two groups namely: **PURINES and PYRIMIDINES**

## **PURINES**

The purine nucleotide bases are ADENINE and GUANINE. They consist of a double ring a pyrimidine and an imidazole fused together

   **ADENINE**

   **GUANINE**

## **PYRIMIDINES**


The pyrimidine nucleotide bases are THYMINE, CYTOSINE and URACIL( in RNA) they consist of a single ring.

**CYTOSINE**

**THYMINE**

**URACIL**

> NB a purine usually binds to a pyrimidine
> 
> ADENINE pairs with THYMINE (A::T) with two hydrogen bonds
> GUANINE pairs with CYTOSINE (G::C) with three hydrogen bonds


# STRUCTURE OF RNA
**RNA** is a single stranded molecule that is made up of ribose nucleotide( nitrogenous bases appended to a ribose sugar) attached by phosphodiester bonds as in DNA
The bases include ADENINE, GUANINE, CYTOSINE AND URACIL
A pairs with U
C pairs with G

There 3 common types of RNAs: messenger RNA (mRNA), Transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
- mRNA-Carries genetic information from DNA in nucleus to ribosomes which is the site of translation in the cytoplasm
- rRNA- encodes the ribosome protein subunit
- tRNA-bring specific amino acid to the ribosome to which  then link to form proteins
