# THE GENETIC CODE
- The universal genetic code is made up of several codons or triplet bases
- There are a total of 64 codons in the genetic code arising from the permutation and combination of the 4 bases in nucleic acids.
- There are two 'punctuation marks' in the genetic code called the START and STOP codons which signal the start and end of protein synthesis in all organisms.

## THE START CODON
The codon AUG is called the START codon as it the first codon in the transcribed mRNA that undergoes translation. AUG is the most common START codon and it codes for the amino acid methionine (Met) in eukaryotes and formyl methionine (fMet) in prokaryotes. During protein synthesis, the tRNA recognizes the START codon AUG with the help of some initiation factors and starts translation of mRNA.

## THE STOP CODON
There are 3 STOP codons in the genetic code - UAG, UAA, and UGA. These codons signal the end of the polypeptide chain during translation. These codons are also known as nonsense codons or termination codons as they do not code for an amino acid.During protein synthesis, STOP codons cause the release of the new polypeptide chain from the ribosome. This occurs because there are no tRNAs with anticodons complementary to the STOP codons.
