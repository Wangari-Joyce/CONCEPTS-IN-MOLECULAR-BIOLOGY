# MUTATIONS
- mutations refer to alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism or virus
- Mutations may result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to  mutagens, or infection by viruses. 

## TYPES OF MUTATIONS
|Class of Mutation|	Type of Mutation|	Description|
| ---| ---|---|
|Point mutation	|Substitution|	One base is incorrectly added during replication and replaces the pair in the corresponding position on the complementary strand|
|Point mutation| Insertion|	One or more extra nucleotides are inserted into replicating DNA, often resulting in a frameshift|
|Point mutation|Deletion|	One or more nucleotides is "skipped" during replication or otherwise excised, often resulting in a frameshift|
|Chromosomal mutation|	Inversion|	One region of a chromosome is flipped and reinserted	
|chromosomal mutation|Deletion|	A region of a chromosome is lost, resulting in the absence of all the genes in that area	
|chromosomal mutation|Duplication|	A region of a chromosome is repeated, resulting in an increase in dosage from the genes in that region
|chromosomal mutation |Translocation|	A region from one chromosome is aberrantly attached to another chromosome	
|Copy number variation|	Gene amplification|	The number of tandem copies of a locus is increased	
|Copy number variation|Expanding trinucleotide repeat|	The normal number of repeated trinucleotide sequences is expanded
