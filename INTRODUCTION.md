# IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS
1. DNA- deoxyribonucleicacid, this is the molecule that carries genetic information from in all living things. it is made up of two strands wound around each other to form a double helix. it contains nitrogeneous bases attached to a sugar-(deoxyribose) phosphate backbone. This bases are ADENINE, GUANINE CYTOSINE AND THYMINE.

2. RNA- Ribonucleic acid, this is a molecule which is similar to DNA but unlike DNA, it contains a ribose sugar,it is single stranded and its bases include a Uracil and lacks thymine. it also contains a sugar(ribose) phosphate backbone.

3. AMINO ACIDS- this are organic molecules that combine together to form proteins. they are made up of compounds : nitrogen,carbon, hydrogen oxygen and a variable side chain group

4. PROTEINS- This are large complex molecules that play important roles in the body. they are made up on hundreds or thousands of smaller units the amino acids. the sequence of amino acids determines each protein's unique structure and its specific function.

5. CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY- this refers to the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to make a functional protein
